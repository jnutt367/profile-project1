        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In 1996 I swore an oath to my country that I love and it was my honor to serve it with pride.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve been a service industry professional and bar-tender for many restaurants and specifically Stefano's Trattoria for about 11 years. I will miss it very much but I believe there are more safe avenues of income during these times of uncertainty.</p>
        <p>I have spent most of my life serving others and don't intend to stop just because of some social limitations. Our minds are strong and I intend to gather with like minded people and overcome the adversity that we are all facing together.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>I have a family that I love and a passion for making the world better. Also, we have an 18 year old son with low-functioning autism whos immune system is already compromised and will do anything to keep him provided for and safe.</p>
        <p>Ultimately I know that my hard work, perserverance and faith will lead me to be a beneficial team member that brings these attributes to a firm:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Integrity</li>
          <li>Professionalism</li>
          <li>Teamwork</li>
          <li>Drive</li>
          <li>Sense of humor</li>
          
        </ul>
        <p>I would love to work for a web development/design company helping clients build a creative and impressive online design structure that gives them an edge over their competitors.</p>
