        <h2>Hope</h2>
        <p>It is my firm belief that hope is the one thing that binds us all together. For those of you that choose hope, I am your friend</p>
        <p>For those of you that choose hopelessness...I am your friend also. If it weren't for hope none of this would be possible.</p>
        <p>Hope for a future with peace and harmony where we all work together. And hope that we are for and not against one another</p>

        <h2>Fear</h2>
        <p>Fear is what grips us when we focus on circumstance and not principles and goodness and what is overall right.</p>
        <p>I have hope for a fearless future full of hope and love for our fellow humans. One where the life of the person next to us means <b>more</b> to
        us than our own and we don't look at others as less than depending on where they are from or what color their skin is. We all know things
    are crazy right now, but that doesn't have to dictate our individual sanity and respect for human life</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Love</li>
          <li>Compassion</li>
          <li>Decency</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would love to see us all take these 3 important principles more seriously as we trudge toward the road to happy destiny.</p>
